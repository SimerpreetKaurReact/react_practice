5. useReducer:Simple login app with useReducer,useContext, with seperate custom context provider component,with custom input, button components
6. food order app: another useReducer, useContext example

Rules of Hooks

1. Only call react hooks in react functions: react component functions, custom hooks
2. Only call hooks at top level, dont call them in nested functions, and neither in block statements
3. Always add everything you refer to inside the useEffect as a dependency
